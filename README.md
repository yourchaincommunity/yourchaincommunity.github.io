YOURChain’s platform architecture is a decentralized, economically sustainable public compute infrastructure. The platform design results from the inspirations of earlier blockchains and builds on top of the shoulders of giants in the disciplines of mathematics and   programming   language   design.

YOURChain is a multi-dimensional blockchain, it is partitioned (sharded) by design thus culminates a network of coordinated and parallel blockchains. 

This unique design presents the opportunity to deploy smart contracts on an independent blockchain and networks without necessarily verifying execution on a single monolithic blockchain. The need for a node to completely sync is ultimately over.

YOURChain operates via ashared “Micro Chain” premise where nodes are not required to replicate the entire blockchain. Multiple independent nodes coalesce their chain states to form a unified chain state. This set the stage for a revolutionary breakthrough in blockchain technology. Micro Chain is the FUTURE!.

The YOURChain cryptoverse is powered by URVM (Universal Redundant Virtual Machine). URVM establish the ecosystem with the capacity to become “hyper-distributed” while maintaining performance costs and network requirements low. This quantum leap eradicates common barriers thus encouraging more developers to embrace YOUR Chain cryptoverse. 

The URVM concept enables multiple, ultra-lightweight nodes to function in tandem or in singularity based on the hardware specifications and user preferences. URVM technology can achieve unrivaled throughput, availability, and response time, which will surpass modern day payment, clearing, and settlement systems.
